# HandsOnMLwithSKLearn
In this repository we are going to provide a brief summary of the book  Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow. If you are a little familier with Machine Learning and you want to learn how to use it in practice and projects, this is the book for you. This book has codes, good pictures and it's easy to read. Ofcourse reading the original book is way more useful. But if you don't have the time, I have gathered this summary. This summary is more useful for people who has read this book before and now they want repeat the main points of the book.

I tried to bring codes and pictures and main parts which are important. but for the sake of summerization, many details has been left out. I repeat, if you have the time, it's better to read the whole book.

For using this summary, you should have Microsoft OneNote. 

Hope you enjoy this repository!
